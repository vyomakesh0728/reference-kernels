<<<PROBLEM DESCRIPTION>>>
batched matrix-vector multiplication kernel optimized for NVIDIA B200.
To be explicit, you will be given a tuple of tensors:
```
(a, b, sfa, sfb, c)
```
where:
* `a` is M x K x L in K-major order in nvfp4(e2m1)
* `b` is 1 x K x L in K-major order in nvfp4(e2m1)
* `sfa` is M x (K // 16) x L in K-major order in fp8(e4m3fnuz)
* `sfb` is 1 x (K // 16) x L in K-major order in fp8(e4m3fnuz)
* `c` is M x 1 x L in fp16
<<<END OF PROBLEM DESCRIPTION>>>

Matrix sizes `M` is divisible by mma_tiler_mn[0] defined in the kernel, `K` is divisible by 64.
The ranking criteria is the geometric mean of the benchmark results.

The speed of light analysis based on the max(FFMA math throughput, DRAM memory throughput) of B200 and tested under 1.5Ghz clock:
M K L time[us]
7168 16384 1 ?
4096 7168 8 ?
7168 2048 4 ?
