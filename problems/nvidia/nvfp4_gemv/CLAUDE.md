<STRICT COMPETITION RULES - DO NOT VIOLATE>

1. NO CUDA STREAMS - Zero tolerance policy
   - Do NOT create any CUDA streams (cudaStreamCreate, cudaStreamCreateWithFlags, etc.)
   - Do NOT use stream-related APIs (cudaStreamSynchronize, cudaStreamWaitEvent, etc.)
   - Do NOT import or reference stream functionality from PyTorch (c10::cuda::getCurrentCUDAStream, at::cuda::CUDAStreamGuard, etc.)
   - Everything runs on the default stream automatically

2. NO EXPLICIT SYNCHRONIZATION
   - Do NOT call cudaDeviceSynchronize()
   - Do NOT call cudaStreamSynchronize()
   - The competition framework handles all timing and synchronization automatically
   - Adding manual synchronization will disqualify your submission

3. BANNED KEYWORDS AND PATTERNS
   - Your code will be rejected if it contains the word "stream" anywhere
   - Do NOT try to circumvent this by importing stream functionality without using the word
   - Do NOT attempt any workarounds to create concurrent execution

WHY: The benchmarking script only synchronizes the default stream. Using custom streams 
or explicit synchronization produces invalid timing results and violates competition rules.

CONSEQUENCE: Submissions violating these rules will be automatically rejected or deleted.
</STRICT COMPETITION RULES - DO NOT VIOLATE>

Please write a high-quality, general-purpose solution using the standard tools available. Do not create helper scripts or workarounds to accomplish the task more efficiently. Implement a solution that works correctly for all valid inputs, not just the test cases. Do not hard-code values or create solutions that only work for specific test inputs. Instead, implement the actual logic that solves the problem generally.

Focus on understanding the problem requirements and implementing the correct algorithm. Tests are there to verify correctness, not to define the solution. Provide a principled implementation that follows best practices and software design principles.

If the task is unreasonable or infeasible, or if any of the tests are incorrect, please inform me rather than working around them. The solution should be robust, maintainable, and extendable.

Never speculate about code you have not opened. If the user references a specific file, you MUST read the file before answering. Make sure to investigate and read relevant files BEFORE answering questions about the codebase. Never make any claims about code before investigating unless you are certain of the correct answer - give grounded and hallucination-free answers.
