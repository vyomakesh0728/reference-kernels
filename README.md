## Reference Kernels

This repo holds reference kernels for the KernelBot which hosts regular competitions on [discord.gg/gpumode](discord.gg/gpumode).

You can see what's going on [gpumode.com](https://www.gpumode.com/)

## Competition
1. [PMPP practice problems](https://github.com/gpu-mode/reference-kernels/tree/main/problems/pmpp_v2)
2. [AMD $100K kernel competition](problems/amd)
3. [BioML kernels](problems/bioml)
4. [AMD $100K distributed kernel competition](problems/amd_distributed)
5. [NVIDIA Blackwell NVFP4 competition](problems/nvidia)

## Making a Leaderboard Submission

Please take a look at `vectoradd_py` to see multiple examples of expected submisisons ranging from PyTorch code to Triton to inline CUDA.


## Contributing New Problems

To add a new problem, create a new folder in the `problems/glory` directory where you need to add the following files:
- `reference.py` - This is the PyTorch reference implementation of the problem.
- `task.yml` - This is the problem specification that will be used to generate test cases for different shapes
- `task.py` - Specifies the schema of the inputs and outputs for the problem

You can evaluate problems with your own Modal account (they give you a free $30) by borrowing this [neat script from @gau-nernst](https://github.com/gpu-mode/reference-kernels/pull/96#issue-3850136894)
